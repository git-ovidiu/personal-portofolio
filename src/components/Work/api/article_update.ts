			text: "At my current role as a technical support specialist for Gmail at Google, I have developed a deep understanding of email authentication protocols like SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance). These technologies are crucial for preventing email spoofing and phishing, ensuring that legitimate emails are properly authenticated, while keeping malicious actors at bay. I am proficient in configuring these protocols and troubleshooting issues that arise, ensuring secure email communication for both internal and external clients."

			text: "Beyond authentication, I have honed my skills in managing email encryption protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) and S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). These protocols are essential for maintaining data integrity and privacy during email transmission. I frequently work with MX records to ensure accurate routing of emails and handle SMTP Relay setups for smooth email flow across different servers. I am well-versed in configuring and optimizing these systems to improve deliverability while maintaining security standards."

I regularly dive into message header analysis to identify and resolve problems related to failed deliveries, bounce handling, and issues caused by misconfigured DNS settings. This process involves understanding SMTP response codes, analyzing the mail flow management system, and ensuring that server configurations, such as quota management, are set correctly to prevent bottlenecks and improve email delivery efficiency. I am adept at resolving these challenges quickly to minimize downtime for users."

I monitor domain reputation to ensure that our email servers maintain a high level of trust, preventing them from being flagged by spam filters. My experience also includes deploying measures for phishing detection and prevention, ensuring that emails are filtered and secured from fraudulent activities. These efforts significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and help maintain a secure email environment."
